## üí∞ **Financial Processing**

### **Daily Interest Calculation**
```php
$dailyInterest = $investment->amount * ($investment->daily_profit_percent / 100);
```

### **Final Payout Calculation**
```php
$finalPayout = $investment->amount + $investment->accrued_interest;
```

### **Referral Commission**
```php
$referralCommission = $investment->amount * ($plan->referral_percent / 100);
```

## üîç **Monitoring & Logs**

### **Log Messages**
- `ProcessInvestmentJob: Processing investment {id}`
- `ProcessInvestmentJob: Credited daily interest {amount} to user {user_id}`
- `ProcessInvestmentJob: Processed maturity for investment {id} with payout {amount}`
- `ProcessInvestmentJob: Credited referral commission {amount} to referrer {referrer_id}`

### **Database Records Created**
- **Ledger Transactions**: All financial movements
- **Income Records**: Income distribution tracking
- **Wallet Updates**: Balance changes

---

## üö® **Error Handling**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Insufficient Wallet Balance**: User doesn't have enough funds for activation
2. **Investment Not Found**: Investment ID doesn't exist
3. **Already Processed**: Investment already processed today (idempotency)

### **Retry Logic**
- Jobs are retried up to 3 times on failure
- Failed jobs are logged for manual review
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
